Red Drumhead is renowned for cooking and pickling, holding its flavour and deep purple-red colour. The colourful vitamin-rich heads are delicious cooked or raw in salads and coleslaw.  Vigorous plants are easy to grow and are adaptable to heat, but for the best flavour they are best timed so the heads mature in the cool weather. ',

These steady producers may take a little while to flower, but once they start they keep on producing throughout the growing season. The plants grow to about 3ft in height and produce blunt-ended fruits with thick, dark green skins that turn to bright red when fully ripe.  The flavour deepens as the peppers ripen and both colours have their classic uses. The green peppers are most often used for roasting, stuffing, pickling and salsas. The gorgeous red peppers are often mesquite-smoked into chipotle, strung on ristras for easy access, or dried and made into a hot chile powder.  Like most peppers, jalapeÃ±o's are self-pollinatingâthey're not dependent on insects for fertility, just a little bit of wind.",
